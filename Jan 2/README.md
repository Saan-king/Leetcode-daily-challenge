### Logic:

== is a reference comparison, i.e. both objects point to the same memory location
.equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.

#### Convert all letters to Uppercase
#### Convert all letters to lowercase
#### Covert all to title(First letter caps)

Keeping in account of those cases where if the first letter of the word is Capital (FlaG) then in the remaining substring must have either
all small (lag) or all capital (LAG) but for your onecap it will be accepted as correct. Also change your == to equals.
