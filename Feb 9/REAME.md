## 2306. Naming a Company

You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.<br/>
Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.<br/>
If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.<br/>
Otherwise, it is not a valid name.<br/>
Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
